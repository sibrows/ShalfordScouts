        <h3>1. Your personal data – what is it?</h3>
        <p>Personal data relates to a living individual who can be identified from that data.  Identification can be by the information alone or in conjunction with any other information in our Scout Group’s (the data controller’s), possession or likely to come into such possession. The processing of personal data is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”).</p>

        <h4>How we gather personal information</h4>
        <p>The majority of the personal information we hold, is provided to us directly by yourself or by parents / legal guardian in either paper form or via our online membership systems, in the case of an adult member, data may also be provided by third party reference agencies, such as the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).</p>

        <p>Where a member is under the age of 18, this information will only be obtained from a parent / guardian and cannot be provided by the young person.</p>

        <h3>3. How do we process your personal data?</h3>
        <p>We comply with our obligations under the “GDPR” by keeping personal data up to date; by storing and destroying it securely; by not collecting or retaining excessive amounts of data; by protecting personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access and disclosure and by ensuring that appropriate technical measures are in place to protect personal data.</p>

        <p>We process the data to have the ability to contact the member, parents and guardians, to inform them of meetings, events that the group itself may be running or attending.</p>

        <p>We use personal data for the following purposes: -</p>

        <h3>4. What is the legal basis for processing your/your child(ren)’s personal data?</h3>
        <p>We only use your personal information where that is permitted by the laws that protect your privacy rights. We only use personal information where:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We need to use the information to comply with our legal obligations</li>
            <li>We need to use the information to contact with you, regarding meetings, events, collection of membership fee’s etc, (i.e. for the day to day running of the group)</li>
            <li>it is fair to use the personal information in your interests, where there is no disadvantage to you – this can include where it is in our interests to contact you about products or services within scouting.</li>
            <li>The processing is necessary for the persons legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of our Scout Group unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5. How we store personal data</h3>
        <p>[PROVIDE DETAILS OF HOW YOU STORE THE PERSONAL DATA YOU COLLECT There are many places this data can be stored, and these will normally be chosen based on ease of use or what you are used to using.  I.E. SPREADSHEETS, PAPER RECORDS IN A LOCKED CABENET, ONLINE COUT MANAGER (OSM].</p>

        <p>We are committed to the protection of your personal information.</p>

        <p>We generally store personal information in one of two secure digital online database systems, where access to that data is restricted and controlled.</p>

        <p>Compass: - is the online membership system of The Scout Association, this system is used for the collection and storage of Adult personal data.</p>

        <p>Online Scout Manager is an online membership system run by Online Youth Manager Ltd, this is a secure membership database where we store the personal information of Adults and Youth members for the day to day running of the group.</p>

        <p>Printed records and Event data</p>
        <p>Paper is still used within the sections to capture and retain some data for example the following: -</p>

        <ul>
            <li>New joiners form.</li>
            <li>New joiners waiting lists.</li>
            <li>Health and contact records update forms.</li>
            <li>Gift Aid Collection forms.</li>
            <li>Events consent from parents.</li>
            <li>Events coordination with event organisers.</li>
            <li>Award notifications/nominations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case of Joining forms, Health and contact update forms, this information is securely held by the leader or waiting list manager, and transferred to our secure digital systems as soon as possible before the paper form is destroyed.</p>

        <p>Gift Aid collection forms, will be securely held by the Groups Treasurer to aid in the collection of Gift Aid for monthly membership fee’s, we have a legal obligation to retain this information for 7 years after our last claim.</p>

        <h4>Events</h4>
        <p>As a member of 1<sup>st</sup> Shalford Scout Group it is hoped you will take up the opportunity to attend events and camps, where is necessary to fulfil our legal obligations we will be required to potentially have a less secure means to access personal information, such as printouts of personal contacts and medical information, (including specific event contact forms), rather than relying on secure digital systems, as often the events are held where internet and digital access will not be available. We will minimise the use of paper to only what is required for the event/camp.</p>

        <p>We will ensure:</p>
        <ol class="abc">
            <li>Transfer of paper is secure, such as physical hand to hand transfer or registered post.</li>
            <li>Paper forms are securely destroyed after use.</li>
            <li>Secure destruction will be through a shredding machine or securely burned.</li>
            <li>Always keeping the paper records secure, especially when in transit, by using:
                <ol>
                    <li>A lockable brief case.</li>
                    <li>A lockable filing cabinet if long term stored.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If transferred to somebody, we will audit that they return them when the event is complete.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Awards</h4>
        <p>Sometimes we may nominate a member for national award, (such as Queens Scout or Duke of Edinburgh award), such nominations would require we provide contact details to the awarding organisation, this is most often done on paper via registered post.</p>

        <h3>6. Sharing and transferring personal Information</h3>
        <p>We will only normally share personal information within our Scout Group leaders and executive members.</p>
